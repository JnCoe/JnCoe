# üìö About Me
I'm driven by curiosity and the thrill of solving complex challenges. My journey began with an early exposure to **programming in law school**, which later led me to specialize in **applied mathematics** and **public administration**. From uncovering hidden insights in massive datasets to designing machine learning models for predictive analysis, I aim to make data meaningful, actionable, and accessible to all.
